The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to determine if a person is a Person of Interest (POI) in the Enron dataset.  A Person of Interest (POI) is someone who was indicted, settled without admitting guilt or testified in exchange for immunity in the Enron Scandal.  The Enron dataset is a collection of emails of about 150 users (145 to be exact) and other financial features.  We will use this dataset to see what features will be used to tell if a user is a POI.  For, there was one notable outlier in the financial data which was the total of the financial features.  I simply dropped that value so it would not affect the analysis.
