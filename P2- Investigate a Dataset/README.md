Since I have been a life-long baseball fan, I have watched at least part of the many World Series since the 1980s.  Itâ€™s amazing to see certain players literally step up and perform at a high level on the biggest stage. 

I investigated Major League Baseball data from history through 2015 of World Series MVPs and tested if there was a significant difference in their play from the regular season and the post season.
