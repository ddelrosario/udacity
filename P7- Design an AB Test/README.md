Made design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. 

Based on a change that Udacity proposed, I conducted an A/B test to see if an evaluation metric, gross conversion, at a 95% confidence interval would be statistically and practically significant between the experiement and control groups.
