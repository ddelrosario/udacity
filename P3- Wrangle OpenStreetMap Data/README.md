Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. 

I chose Manila, Philippines to explore.

I saw with the Manila dataset that there are problems with the data just like any data that relies on human editing and entering.  It’s also incomplete but cleaned enough to be able to do basic statistics reporting.   Since this is my mother’s hometown and I’ve visited twice before, I had some knowledge of the culture.  For the most part, I was not surprised from the food culture but it was extremely interesting to dig into the data.
