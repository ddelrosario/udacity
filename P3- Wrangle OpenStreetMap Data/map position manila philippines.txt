This area represents a part of Manila, Philippines.  Philippines is about 3,000 kilometers south of Japan and about 1,400 kilometers east of Vietnam.  I am filipino but was born and raised in California.   My parents however were born in the Philippines and specifically my mom grew up in this area.  I visited when I was 6 years old and then once again about 20 years later.  It was interesting to dig into this data.
